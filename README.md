# Age of Paragon
A Side Project

## Intro

I started this project with no prior knowledge of Unreal Engine 4 and a desire to develop video games. Since my University has no classes about game development, I had to work on this project without the help of my professors in addition to the schoolwork I already had. To help with this I took what I was learning about the development life cycle of software and other non-game related techniques and apply them where I could during the process. I knew that this would be a large task for me since I would have to learn everything for the first time, I limited the scope of this project to creating a prototype only using Blueprints. Doing this helped me achieve my goal of becoming more familiar with the engine while getting experience. During the development I learned many new concepts and techniques about game development that I would not have learn at my school.

## Prototype Idea
The game that I wanted to create a prototype of is a competivie 2-D type of game where it is a 1v1 where each player has a side (light or dark) and their goal is to send heros from their base to the enemys base to destroy it. There is four types of heros, Melee, Range, Anti-Tank, and Tank these four classes each serve a purpose. For example the Anti-Tank when upgraded would use an ability when only attacking a Tank when upgraded will have an ability to absorb more damage. When a player kills an enemy hero they will be rewared with Gold and EXP where they will use the Gold to spawn more heros and EXP to Level up. When a player levels up they will have access to a new set of heros that will have a new set of abilities that will have to be bought to use them. Another mechanic is Orb Prime(OP), this is a boost that a player can activate that will give them a certian amount of gold and boost any heros that are spawned within a certian amount of time. This allows players to recover from any major mistake they made in the early game but sacrifices a amount of EXP meaning that it will take longer to level up if not used correctly. Orb Prime also allows a player to close out a game if they think that they can over whelm their oppoent with a well timed OP.

## Objectives
 - Create a prototype of an idea I had for a game.
 - Gain experince with the engine by only using Blueprints for this project.

## Milestones 
 - A Health and Experience system for the Bases and Characters.
 - UI that allows users to spawn Characters and access the show while tracking Base Health and Experience.
 - A spawing system.
 - Have the Characters walk forward and attack enemy not Friendly.
 - A shop that has upgrades and Orb Prime.
 - Abilities for certian Characters.
