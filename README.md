# Age of Paragon
A Side Project

## Intro

I started this project with no prior knowledge of Unreal Engine 4 and a desire to develop video games. Since my University has no classes about game development, I had to work on this project without the help of my professors in addition to the schoolwork I already had. To help with this I took what I was learning about the development life cycle of software and other non-game related techniques and apply them where I could during the process. I knew that this would be a large task for me since I would have to learn everything for the first time, I limited the scope of this project to creating a prototype only using Blueprints. Doing this helped me achieve my goal of becoming more familiar with the engine while getting experience. During the development I learned many new concepts and techniques about game development that I would not have learn at my school.

## Prototype Idea
The game that I wanted to create a prototype of is a competitive 2-D type of game where it is a 1v1 where each player has a side (light or dark) and their goal is to send heroes from their base to the enemyâ€™s base to destroy it. There is four types of heroes, Melee, Range, Anti-Tank, and Tank these four classes each serve a purpose. For example, the Anti-Tank when upgraded would use an ability when only attacking a Tank when upgraded will have an ability to absorb more damage. When a player kills an enemy hero, they will be rewarded with Gold and EXP where they will use the Gold to spawn more heroes and EXP to Level up. When a player levels up they will have access to a new set of heroes that will have a new set of abilities that will have to be bought to use them. Another mechanic is Orb Prime (OP), this is a boost that a player can activate that will give them a certain amount of gold and boost any heroes that are spawned within a certain amount of time. This allows players to recover from any major mistake they made in the early game but sacrifices an amount of EXP meaning that it will take longer to level up if not used correctly. Orb Prime also allows a player to close out a game if they think that they can overwhelm their opponent with a well-timed OP.


## Objectives
 - Create a prototype of an idea I had for a game.
 - Gain experince with the engine by only using Blueprints for this project.

## Milestones
