# Age of Paragon
A Side Project

## Intro

I started this project with no prior knowledge of Unreal Engine 4 and a desire to develop video games. Since my University has no classes about game development, I had to work on this project without the help of my professors in addition to the schoolwork I already had. To help with this I took what I was learning about the development life cycle of software and other non-game related techniques and apply them where I could during the process. I knew that this would be a large task for me since I would have to learn everything for the first time, I limited the scope of this project to creating a prototype only using Blueprints. Doing this helped me achieve my goal of becoming more familiar with the engine while getting experience. During the development I learned many new concepts and techniques about game development that I would not have learn at my school.

## Objectives
 - Create a prototype of an idea I had for a game.
 - Gain experince with the engine by only using Blueprints for this project.

## Milestones 
 - A Health and Experience system for the Bases and Characters.
 - UI that allows users to spawn Characters and access the show while tracking Base Health and Experience.
 - A spawing system.
 - Have the Characters walk forward and attack enemy not Friendly.
 - A shop that has upgrades and Orb Prime.
 - Abilities for certian Characters.
